Counterfactual: {{cf}}
Target label: {{target}}

Score each quality dimension from 0.0 to 1.0:
- minimality (fewest necessary edits to reach the target label)
- fluency (grammatical, natural wording)
- label_determinism (clearly expresses the target label, not ambiguous)
- faithfulness (preserves original facts/entities and context)

Return JSON ONLY in English:
