        {
            "text": "first counterfactual variant in English",
            "modification_focus": "which words/phrases were changed"
        },
        {
            "text": "second counterfactual variant in English", 
            "modification_focus": "which words/phrases were changed"
        },
        {

            "modification_focus": "which words/phrases were changed"
