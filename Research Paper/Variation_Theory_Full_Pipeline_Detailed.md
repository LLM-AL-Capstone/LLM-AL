# üß© Variation Theory in Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Active Learning  
### **Full Process / Pipeline (Detailed Markdown Version)**

---

## **1. Problem Context**

- **Active Learning (AL)** helps models query the most informative examples for human labeling.  
- However, AL faces a major challenge ‚Äî the **cold-start problem**.  
  - When the model starts with very little annotated data, it struggles to identify which examples to label next.
  - The model‚Äôs initial performance is unstable and non-generalizable.  
- **Goal:** To enhance early-stage model learning and robustness when labeled data is scarce.

---

## **2. Conceptual Foundation: Variation Theory + Counterfactual Augmentation**

- **Variation Theory** (from human learning research) posits that humans learn concepts best by observing:
  - *What changes (variation)* and
  - *What stays the same (invariance)* across examples.

- **Application to Machine Learning:**  
  Incorporate this theory to guide the creation of *counterfactual examples* ‚Äî modified versions of data points that alter one key feature (e.g., label semantics) while keeping other patterns constant.

- **Main Idea:**  
  Use **neuro-symbolic patterns** (interpretable rules) + **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate synthetic counterfactual data that improves model performance during early AL rounds.

---

## **3. Neuro-Symbolic Pattern Learning (Defining the Concept Space)**

### Step 3.1 ‚Äî Learn Symbolic Patterns Using PaTAT
- Employ **PaTAT (Pattern-based Thematic Annotation Tool)** to capture meaningful, rule-based text structures.  
- Uses **Programming-by-Example (PBE)** to infer domain-specific symbolic rules from a few annotated samples.

### Step 3.2 ‚Äî What the Patterns Represent
- These **patterns** define concept boundaries ‚Äî syntactic and semantic similarities among examples of the same label.

**Components of the Pattern Language:**
- **POS tags:** `NOUN`, `VERB`, `ADJ`, etc.  
- **Entity Types:** `$LOCATION`, `$DATE`, `$ORG`  
- **Word Stems:** `[WORD]` (e.g., `[have]` matches *has, had, having*)  
- **Soft Match:** `(pricey)` ‚Üí matches synonyms like *expensive*, *costly*  
- **Wildcards:** `*` ‚Üí any token sequence  

**Example:**  
- Input Sentences:  
  - ‚ÄúGood food with great variety.‚Äù  
  - ‚ÄúThe food was amazing.‚Äù  
- Learned Pattern: `[food]+*+ADJ`  
  - Captures structure common to both sentences labeled ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù.

## **4. Counterfactual Generation Using Large Language Models (LLMs)**

### Step 4.1 ‚Äî Candidate Phrase Identification
- From learned patterns, identify segments of text (phrases) that can be altered to produce semantic variation.

### Step 4.2 ‚Äî Guided Counterfactual Generation
- Use **GPT-4o** (or **Llama 3.3**) to generate new sentences that:
  - **Retain** syntactic structure (pattern consistency).  
  - **Flip** the semantic label (meaning changes to opposite category).  
  - **Minimize** unnecessary edits.  
  - Maintain **grammatical correctness**.

**Example:**  
> Original: ‚ÄúAffordable lobster with reasonable price.‚Äù (*Label: Price*)  
> Counterfactual: ‚ÄúAffordable lobster with terrible service.‚Äù (*Label: Service*)

### Step 4.3 ‚Äî Controlled Generation
- The model receives the pattern, target label, and allowed phrases as constraints.
- Ensures syntactic integrity while producing meaningful semantic shifts.

## **5. Three-Stage Filtering Pipeline (Ensuring Data Quality)**

After generation, not all counterfactuals are usable ‚Äî so a **three-stage filter** ensures quality control.

| Stage | Filter | Description | Metric |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **C1** | **Regex Heuristic Filter** | Removes malformed or incomplete generations (e.g., repeated prompts, cutoff sentences). | ‚Äî |
| **C2** | **Neuro-Symbolic Filter** | Keeps examples that still match the learned symbolic pattern, ensuring syntactic integrity. | **Pattern Keeping Rate (PKR)** |
| **C3** | **LLM Discriminator Filter (GPT-4o)** | Uses GPT-4o to verify that label has *truly flipped* semantically. | **Label Flip Rate (LFR)** & **Soft Label Flip Rate (SLFR)** |

**Key Metrics Explained:**
- **PKR:** Fraction of examples preserving original symbolic pattern.  
- **LFR:** Fraction of examples that correctly switch to the target label.  
- **SLFR:** Fraction of examples that successfully *remove* the original label meaning.

## **6. Integration with Active Learning Loop**

Once high-quality counterfactuals are ready, they‚Äôre integrated into the active learning pipeline.

### Step 6.1 ‚Äî Augmenting the Dataset
- Pair each original example with its counterfactual version.
- The model now trains on both ‚Äî improving exposure to semantic boundaries.

### Step 6.2 ‚Äî Iterative Learning Procedure
1. Start with few labeled samples.  
2. Train model (BERT or GPT-4o).  
3. Select next batch via one of several strategies:
   - Random  
   - Cluster-based  
   - Uncertainty-based  
   - ALPS (baseline addressing cold start)  
   - Counterfactuals without Variation Theory  
   - **Counterfactuals with Variation Theory (ours)**  
4. Evaluate model performance after each iteration.

## **7. Experiments and Evaluation**

### Datasets
- **YELP:** 4 categories (Service, Price, Environment, Product) ‚Äì 495 samples.  
- **MASSIVE:** 18 intent labels (e.g., weather, music, etc.) ‚Äì 540 samples.  
- **Emotions:** 6 emotion classes (anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise) ‚Äì 500 samples.

### Models
- **BERT (fine-tuned)**  
- **GPT-4o (few-shot)**  

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Macro F1-score** (classification performance)  
- **PKR, LFR, SLFR** (counterfactual quality)

### Results Summary
- **PKR:** 0.81‚Äì0.94 ‚Üí pattern consistency maintained.  
- **LFR:** 0.86‚Äì0.98 ‚Üí high rate of correct label flips.  
- **Performance:** Up to **2√ó F1 improvement** in early stages (<70 annotations).  
- Gains **decline** as labeled data increases (diminishing returns).

## **8. Ablation Study: Impact of Filtering Pipeline**

- Tested multiple configurations:
  - No filters  
  - Heuristic only  
  - Heuristic + Symbolic  
  - Heuristic + LLM  
  - All three combined  
- **Finding:** Using all three filters yields best results ‚Äî consistent 2√ó F1-score improvement over unfiltered generation.
- Statistical significance verified (p < 0.0001).
